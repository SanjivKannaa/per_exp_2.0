# per_exp_2.0
## Pre-requirements
- python 2.0 or later
- python cryptography module
  - can be installed using the install_requirements.py file (this step requires python to be available in the enviornment)
  - or use ***pip install cryptography.fernet***
## How to run
- create a special folder for the program
- put the python file in the folder and run ***init.py*** and set up the password (which can be later changed in the main program if required)
- now run main.py and you are ready to use it in your daily life
## Bonus
- I would suggest you to use services like replit.com to run this program in the cloud so that you can access them on the go without your laptop!
- thanks for using my project.
